## Main styling: Theme-ui

- to access 'webkit' property: write 1st letter capitalized. Ex) 'WebkitBackgroundClip"
- for breakpoints: 1st in array is min-width and everything below, the rest act the same as min-width. ex) breakpoints ['400px', '500px', '800px']
- for breakpoints: in array start from lowest to highest min-width
- to use keyframes: w/in the same object where animation name was called create a keyframes object with quotes and exact syntax. Ex)
  "@keyframes blob": {
  "0%": {
  ///properties here
  }...
  }
